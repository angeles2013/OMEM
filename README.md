# OMEM
The Offline Marine Ecosystem Model is based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) code. The OMEM's marine ecosystem is borrowed - except for some changes- from the Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL). The offline advection-diffusion scheme is based on the Parallel Ocean Program (POP).

OMEM is fully written in Python. To look at the original MARBL fortran code visit https://github.com/marbl-ecosys/MARBL, and to obtain more information about POP go to https://github.com/ESCOMP/POP2-CESM.
